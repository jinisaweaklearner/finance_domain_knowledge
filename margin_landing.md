# Margin Landing
Also known as an investment loan, a margin loan is a secured line of credit that allows you to borrow funds to invest. It’s a bit like a home loan – but where a home loan is secured against your property, a margin loan is secured against your shares or managed funds.

Margin Lending 没有任何费用，除了银行贷款给你的利息。
Basically就是银行借钱给你买股票，所以银行根据股票的质地按百分比来贷给你，通常每个银行会有一张表, 里面有每个股贷款的百分比，最高的大概是银行贷给你75%，像4大银行的股票，最低是你自己出100%，银行不会借贷给你，这些质地差的股票你在表格中看不到的。
操作上假如你买ANZ 100股@$20.00, 这样总价值是$2000.00, 银行贷给你75%，即$1500.00, 你自己出$500.00, 但一般有一个buffer, 你的资金必须有可能$600, 或$700, 这样万一股价波动你不会有margin call.
所以你所支出的是银行利息，利息对你税务有好处，具体要咨询accountant.


### LVR (Loan to Value Ratio)
Every security in an ASL is assigned a Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) which represents how much you can borrow against that security. LVR is generally based on things like the size of a listed company or managed fund, its financial performance, and how volatile its securities are. For example, if BHP has an LVR of 80% and you want to buy $10,000 worth of shares, the bank will lend $8,000 and you’ll need to fund the remaining $2,000 yourself using cash or other shares.

### ASL
An Approved Securities List (ASL) lists all the shares and managed funds a lender is willing to accept as collateral. If you already own shares that are listed in the ASL, you’ll be able to use those shares as collateral. If you want to make new purchases of shares that are listed in the lender’s ASL, they will lend you funds up to the LVR for that security.

### margin call
A margin call is a process to make sure your loan never exceeds your maximum LVR. If your loan to portfolio ratio increases too much (because the shares you’re using as loan collateral have decreased in value) a margin call will be triggered. If you reach a margin call, the lender will ask you to top up your loan with extra cash, or by selling some of your investments.

Margin loan accounts generally have a “buffer” of around 5%. The buffer is an additional LVR provided by the lender to allow for small market movements. It gives you some extra time to take action before your loan reaches a margin call.
